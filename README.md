# Nagamochi Ibaraki Algorithm

Create an implementation of the Nagamochi-Ibaraki algorithm (see in the lecture notes) for finding a minimum cut in an undirected graph, and experiment with it.

Explain how your implementation of the algorithm works. 

Provide pseudo code for the description, with sufficient comments to make it readable and understandable by a human.

Write a computer program that implements the algorithm. You may use C/C++ or java for programming.

Run the program on randomly generated examples. Let the number of nodes be fixed at n = 25, while the number m of edges will vary between 50 and 550, increasing in steps of 5. Once a value of m is selected, the program creates a graph with n = 25 nodes and m edges.
 
The actual edges are selected randomly among all possible ones, with parallel edges allowed, but self-loops are excluded.

Submit the code.
